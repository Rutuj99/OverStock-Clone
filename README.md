## Project Challenges and Learnings

During the project, we faced several challenges, including implementing the shopping cart and sorting system, setting up user authentication and authorization, and integrating the front-end and back-end(localstorage).

## Future Scope

In the future, we plan to add more features to our Overstock clone, such as a product recommendation system, customer reviews, and a more advanced search functionality. We also plan to improve the performance and responsiveness of the website.

## Conclusion

 Overall, our first project in Masai School's Full-Stack Web Development program was a challenging and rewarding experience. We gained valuable experience in web development and worked as a team to create a fully functional website. We are excited to continue learning and building new projects in the future.
